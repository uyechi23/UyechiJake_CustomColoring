# UyechiJake_CustomColoring

This repository is for Jake Uyechi's submission of the Custom Coloring assignment for SP22 CS301 - Object-Oriented Programming.

The app in this repository draws the Southern sky on the morning of January 30, 2019, when Mars, Jupiter, and the Moon were all relatively close to the constellation Libra.
It draws the seven major stars in the Libra constellation, as well as the two planets (Mars/Jupiter), and the Moon.
